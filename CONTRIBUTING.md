## PR checklist

- [ ] No secrets, tokens, credentials, or personal IDs included
- [ ] Knowledge entries use placeholder examples (not real IDs)
- [ ] CLI scripts are executable (`chmod +x bin/my-script`)
- [ ] Docs files use UPPERCASE names (`docs/MY-DOC.md`)
- [ ] No team-specific names, URLs, or tool instances hardcoded
- [ ] Stale bin/ references outside docs/MIGRATION.md replaced with agent-toolkit equivalents

---

## Adding processes

When adding a new tool process (e.g., a new project management tool):

- [ ] Create `knowledge/processes/<tool>.md`
- [ ] Use placeholder IDs, not real ones
- [ ] Document the skill/CLI invocation pattern
- [ ] Add an entry to the routing table in `AGENTS.md`
